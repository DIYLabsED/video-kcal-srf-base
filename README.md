# [Video] Kcalbeloh Surface Base Shenanigans
### A repo for me to dump saves/crafts/other files related to my [Kcalbeloh Surface Base Shenanigans project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtNxsQsltPqwcInNB2EIN_fjHIs7R37vB).
### Modlist
I have uploaded a `.ckan` file, which you can feed to CKAN to get all of the mods I am using. *Note: I also have volumetric clouds release 4 in this instance.*

For some parts/modules, I have made custom configs. Your instance may or may not work without these configs, but I recommend you get them, just to be safe. After downloading, drop them into your `[KSP Instance]/GameData` folder. These do not directly edit other mods's config files, but use ModuleManager to load the edits at loadtime. This means you can remove my config files from your `GameData` folder, and go back to what you had before.


### Craft files
I have uploaded `.craft` files for everything I have made. You can copy these into `[Your KSP Instance]/saves/[Your Save Name]/Ships/SPH` or `[KSP Instance]/saves/[Your Save Name]/Ships/VAB`. Alternatively, you can download my save file, which also contains the surface base in whatever state is most recent.

### Save files
I will upload save files regularly, so you can view my progress yourself, or play with my save. Copy this into `[Your KSP Instance]/saves`, and you should see a new save pop up in KSP.
